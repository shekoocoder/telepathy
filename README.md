### Tech

TelePathy uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] -  
* [QTUMJS] -  
* [SWIFT] - 
* [QTUM] -  
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](http://breakdance.io) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [IBM Watson] - duh

And of course TelePathy itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
